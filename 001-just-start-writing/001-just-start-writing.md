# Just Start Writing

Most of what we expect from a developer is to write code that solves problems. We mostly expect them to take a problem as an input, perform some logic and critical thinking on it, then generate the code as an output.

Developers are expected to write code, not text, except for documentation or emails.

But I want you to write for yourself. Not to solve a problem, not to code, not for machines. But for humans. I want you to tell me your story. I want you to teach me something. I want you to share your day, your thoughts, your ideas. I want you to express the complexity in your mind with fellow humans.

Being too much restricted to writing logic can make you less human, overly analytical. But that's not what life is about; life is about interaction with other humans. Machines are just a means. Even the app you're coding is meant to communicate with other humans: We call them "users" or "customers."

So please, start writing. I know so many very interesting developers who do not write. They are very inspiring and very smart people. And very funny too. But their only writings are cold code. Sure, there is art in code, but not as much as in human language.

Ask your fellow developers what are the benefits of writing. Most of them are perfectly aware of what are the benefits: Enhanced communication skills, improved reasoning, knowledge sharing, career boost, online presence,... etc. But very few really write, and fewer write consistently.

## Why?

I see a couple of reasons:

Fear is the most common reason. Whether we admit it or not, we are afraid of others' judgment. "My writing is not that good", "I'm too junior, my opinion doesn't matter",...

You are not. I was never severely judged about my writing, and even if I am, I know someone somewhere will find it useful.

> The best moment to write is when you learn something. Do it because it strengthens your learning, and it will help others who want to learn the same things as you. It's like peer-learning rather than a formal course from a senior person.
Another reason is "But no one needs it", or "This was covered so many times, people will not need my own take on that".

This is wrong. Again, do it to strengthen your new skills. Do it for your future-self, explained in your own words. No need to make it another O'Reilly! Explain it like you say it.

And what about the "I don't have time"?

You have time.

I wrote this issue in 30 minutes. The moment you start writing, it becomes hypnotizing. I just can't stop writing my ideas, and many feel like that. 30 minutes a week is all you need. And if you really don't have time, Tweet! It takes 30 seconds to write tweets. Do it once a day, and it becomes a valuable habit.

Finally, one argument I hear is "I don't have ideas".

You have a ton of ideas!

What was the last question you asked ChatGPT? What were you looking for on StackOverflow? What your Twitter feed is about? What was the last topic you interacted with on Reddit? All of that can be an inspiration for writing.

The moment you have an idea, write it down in your Note app. When you get time to expand the subject, you already have a record of ideas that inspired you.

Forget the 2000-words rule! It's BS, you are writing to give value to humans, not to have a high SEO ranking for Google!

## Writing is a Therapy

Write to share your thoughts. Write to purge the frustration of your cubicle. Write to make other developers feel not alone. Share what you Googled, what you learned. Share how ChatGPT is suggesting you solve a problem, your latest StackOverflow question. Share how you end your days, playing games, doing football, reading books. No matter what you do, share. The world needs more and more inspiring people. Developers are not an exception; we are not different.

Writing is a mindset. It will help others get inspired, learn new stuff, but more importantly, help you express your thoughts clearly. It's a self-helping tool to declutter your mind. If you have no readers, your future self will be thankful for what you shared.

## Don't Make it Complicated

No need for high-tech tools. I'm writing these lines in a Markdown file with Sublime Text. I'm publishing using Substack. This is no sci-fi stuff. I write as I speak; there is no need to make this the next bestseller. I do it because I know someone will find these lines inspiring. I know at least for me, I find this useful. If I can convince one person to start writing, I will consider this "Mission accomplished."

You don't need to block 2 hours to write, or wake up at 5 am to write (BS!). I'm writing these lines because I got inspired to write them. I blocked 30 minutes on my calendar, started a clock, and I'll stop when the bell rings. Next is to give this ChatGPT to fix the misspellings. And Voil√†! Just hit publish and continue my day.

I know myself (and many are like me): If it takes too long, if there's too much preparation, I'll stop and won't continue. The secret to keep going with anything and make it a habit is to lower the barrier of action as low as possible.

Until then, take care.
